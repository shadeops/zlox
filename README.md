Exploration of Crafting Interpreters with Zig

WIP of going through https://craftinginterpreters.com/ in Zig.

### General Note

During the first pass through the book I'm attempting to match the approaches taken in the text fairly closely, even if this is a bit at odds with Zig.
Currently much is being done at run-time through interfaces but this perhaps could have been approached using generics through comptime.
